# Introduction

In one part of the edX course series  ["Data Science Professional Certificate"](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard) from Rafael Irizarry, the capstone task, named MovieLens Project, is to build a prediction algorithm for movie ratings. As a motivating example a recommendation challenge for the data science community is mentioned, in which Netflix offered one million dollars for the data science team, that would improves the movie recommendation system by 10 %.
The Netflix data is not publicly available, so Professor Irizarry provides links to the GroupLens research lab database.\hfill\break\break 
The dataset downloaded from there, comprises of `r dim(movielens)[1]` observations with `r dim(movielens)[2]` recorded features.

```{r,  fig.fullwidth = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A subset of the data with recorded features"}
knitr::kable(movielens[1:6, 1:6], 
             caption = "A subset of the data with recorded features")
```

\hfill\break Each row represents a user rating a certain movie with values between 0 (the worst possible rating) and  `r range(movielens$rating)[2]` (the best possible rating). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.caption = "frequency distribution of ratings"}
tabyl(edx$rating) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "frequency distribution of ratings")
```

\hfill\break In the dataset used in the MovieLens project `r movielens %>% summarize(dist = n_distinct(userId)) %>% .$dist` distinct users rate `r movielens %>% summarize(dist = n_distinct(movieId)) %>% .$dist` distinct movies.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.caption = "distinct users and movies"}
movielens %>% summarize(n_distinct_users = n_distinct(userId), 
                        n_distinct_movies = n_distinct(movieId)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "distinct users and movies")
```

\hfill\break If every user rates every movie our dataset should comprise of `r movielens %>% summarize(n_distinct_users = n_distinct(userId), n_distinct_movies = n_distinct(movieId)) %>% summarize(multiplied = n_distinct_users*n_distinct_movies) %>% .$multiplied ` rows. But the actual data set has only `r nrow(movielens)` rows. This implies that not every user rated every movie. 
In the MovieLens Project one could implement information of a specific user, movie and related movies to predict the rating of that specific user on a new, unknown movie. 

# Analysis

## Exploratory data analysis

In order to only use the train dataset for exploration/training of the prediction algorithm we will look at a data partition of the MovieLens data. This subset is termed edx and comprises of `r dim(edx)[1]` observations.


```{r, fig.cap="number of ratings per user", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
edx %>% group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n),col = "black") + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black") + 
  xlim(0, 1000)+scale_x_log10()+
  labs(x = "number of ratings", 
       y = "count of distinct users")
```

\hfill\break Some users seem to rate every movie they watch, whereas others rate more rarely. 

```{r, fig.cap="number of ratings per movie", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

edx %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n))+
  geom_histogram(color = "black")+
  scale_x_log10()+
  labs(x = "number of ratings", 
       y = "count of distinct movies")
```

\hfill\break The same trend can be seen in the number of ratings per movie. Some movies seem to be pretty popular, whereas others are only rated by few users.

```{r, fig.cap = "mean rating of individual movies", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE}

edx %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(n_movies = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(n_movies) %>% 
  mutate(cut_movies = cut(n_movies, 
                          breaks = quantile(
                            n_movies, 
                            probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1)))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(cut_movies)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_rating, fill = cut_movies))+
  geom_histogram()+scale_fill_discrete(
    name = "number of movie observations")

```

\hfill\break No real trend is observed. Independent of users or number of ratings, some movies tend to have higher mean_ratings than others. In the following analysis this observation is called "movie-effects".

\hfill\break
\hfill\break

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE , fig.cap="mean rating of individual users 1", cache = TRUE}
edx %>% 
  group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(n_user = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  mutate(cut_users = cut(n_user, 
                         breaks = quantile(
                           n_user,
                           probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1)))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cut_users)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_rating, fill = cut_users)) + 
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(x = "mean_rating of users")+
  scale_fill_discrete("number of ratings per user")
```

\hfill\break Some users seem to give better mean_ratings then other users, independent of the number of ratings per user and the acutal movie. In the following analysis this observation is called "user-effects".

```{r, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="mean rating of individual users 2", fig.height=6, fig.width=4, cache = TRUE}
edx %>% group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(n_user = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  filter(n_user > 2500) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(userId, mean_rating), y = mean_rating))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()
```

```{r, fig.cap="mean_rating per genre", fig.height=8, fig.width=6, fig.cap="mean rating per genre 1", cache = TRUE}
edx %>% 
  group_by(genres) %>% 
  summarize(n_genres = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  filter(n_genres > 50000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(genres, mean_rating), 
             y = mean_rating))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()
```

```{r, fig.margin = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="mean rating per genre 2", echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
edx %>% 
  group_by(genres) %>% 
  summarize(n_genres= n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  mutate(
    cut_genres = cut(n_genres, 
                          breaks = quantile(
                            n_genres, 
                            probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1)))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cut_genres)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_rating, fill = cut_genres))+
  geom_histogram()
```

\hfill\break Independent of users, different genres have different mean_ratings. In the following analysis this observation is termed "genres-effects".


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap= "time dependency of movie ratings"}
edx %>% 
  mutate(date_time = lubridate::as_datetime(timestamp)) %>% 
  mutate(week = 
           lubridate::round_date(date_time, 
                                      unit = "week")) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarize(n_week = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, mean_rating))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "darkred")
```

\hfill\break The mean_rating across movies, genres, users also seems to be time dependent. 
In the following analysis this observation is termed "week-effects".

## Modelling approaches

In order to not overtrain or overfit a model, the train datapartition edx also has to be split in train- and test-set. To build the algorithm only the test set is going to be used.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# create train and test data set
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

test_index <- createDataPartition(edx$rating, times = 1, p = 0.2, list = FALSE)

train_set_incomplete <- edx[-test_index,]
test_set_incomplete <- edx[test_index,]

# to make sure to have the same movieIds and userIds in train- and test_set
test_set <- test_set_incomplete %>% 
  semi_join(train_set_incomplete, by = "movieId") %>% 
  semi_join(train_set_incomplete, by = "userId")

#row_bind the dropped rows to the train_set
removed <- anti_join(test_set_incomplete, test_set)
train_set <- rbind(train_set_incomplete, removed)
saveRDS(train_set, "train_set")
saveRDS(test_set, "test_set")
```

```{r}
# load data set
train_set <- readRDS("train_set")
test_set <- readRDS("test_set")

# using library(lubridate) to transform the timestamp into date format

train_set <- train_set %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_datetime(timestamp))
train_set  <- train_set %>% 
  mutate(week = lubridate::round_date(date, "week"))

test_set <- test_set %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_datetime(timestamp))
test_set <- test_set %>% 
  mutate(week = lubridate::round_date(date, "week"))
```

To evaluate the performance of different models, a loss function is needed.
In the MovieLens project, as in the Netflix challenge, the residual mean squared error (RMSE) is used.

```{r eval = FALSE}
RMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
    sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
  }
```

Taking together the four effects(user-effects(u), movie-effects(i), genres-effects(g), week-effects(w)) observed in the exploratory data analysis, the first model could look like this:

$Y_{u, i, g, w} = \mu + b_{u}+b_{i}+b_{g}+b_{w}+\varepsilon_{u, i, g, w}$

\hfill\break with the bs as "effects" and $\varepsilon_{u, i, g, w}$ as independend errors by random variation.
\hfill\break As descriped in the corresponding chapter of Rafael IrizarryÂ´s book ["Introduction to Data Science"]("https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/large-datasets.html#recommendation-systems") one can use the least squares to estimate the effects $b_{u}, b_{i}, b_{g}, b_{w}$:

```{r}
  mu <- mean(train_set$rating)
  
  movie_effects_reg <- train_set %>% 
    group_by(movieId) %>% 
    summarize(b_i = mean(rating - mu))
  
  user_effects_reg <- train_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    group_by(userId) %>% 
    summarize(b_u = mean(rating - mu - b_i)) 
  
  genre_effects_reg <- train_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    group_by(genres) %>% 
    summarize(b_g = mean(rating- mu - b_i - b_u))
  
  week_effects_reg <- train_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    left_join(genre_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
    group_by(week) %>% 
    summarize(b_w = mean(rating - mu - b_i - b_u - b_g))
  
  prediction <- test_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    left_join(genre_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
    left_join(week_effects_reg, by = "week") %>% 
    mutate(pred = mu+b_i+b_u+b_g+b_w) %>% 
    pull(pred)
  
  
  rmse <- caret::RMSE(test_set$rating, prediction)
  
rmse

```

LetÂ´s explore the largest mistakes of the prediction:

```{r}
errors <- test_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    left_join(genre_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
    left_join(week_effects_reg, by = "week") %>% 
    mutate(residual = rating - (mu+b_i+b_u+b_g+b_w), 
           prediction = mu+b_i+b_u+b_g+b_w) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(residual)))

errors[1:5, c("movieId",  "residual", "rating")] %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = 
                 "the 5 largest residuals in the training set")
```

\hfill\break The largest mistakes seem to be made when predicting rather obscure movies, with very large or very small ratings.

\hfill\break Lets look at the training data, based on which the predictions were made:

```{r}
# subset errors
errors_subset <- errors %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(mean_residual = mean(abs(residual))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(mean_residual)))


# look at the number of observations with the biggest prediction errors

train_set %>% 
  right_join(errors_subset, by = "movieId") %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(n_movie = n(), mean_residual = mean(abs(mean_residual)), 
            mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(mean_residual))) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "the 10 worst predictions based on the training data")
```

\hfill\break The biggest absolute errors are observed, when predicting ratings with just a view observed movies. Even with the model taking into account all four observed effects, the residuals are largest in the movies with a low number of observations.

```{r}
train_set %>% 
  right_join(errors_subset, by = "movieId") %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(n_movie = n(), mean_residual = mean(abs(mean_residual)), 
            mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(mean_residual))) %>% 
  slice(1:100) %>% 
  summarize(mean_n = mean(n_movie), mean_mean_residual = mean(abs(mean_residual)))
```

The biggest 100 mean_errors stratified by movieId have an average number of observations in the train_set of 8.2.

\hfill\break When looking at the numbers of ratings from each recoreded user, a similar observation can be made.

```{r}
errors_subset <- errors %>% 
  group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(mean_residual = mean(abs(residual))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(mean_residual)))


train_set %>% 
  right_join(errors_subset, by = "userId") %>% 
  group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(n_user = n(), 
            mean_residual = mean(mean_residual), 
            mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(mean_residual))) %>% 
  slice(1:100) %>% 
  summarize(mean_n = mean(n_user), 
            mean_mean_residual = mean(abs(mean_residual)))
```

\hfill\break The largest 100 mean_errors stratified by userId have an average number of observations in the train_set of 25.


\hfill\break With only a view users rating a movie in our train_set sample, we have much uncertainty about the true movie rating in the population. The idea of **regularization** is to penalize the least squares estimates, which have few numbers of observations.
To formulate this mathematically for a penalized effect $b_{i}$:

$$
\hat{b}_i(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda + n_i} \sum_{u=1}^{n_i} \left(Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}\right)
$$

\hfill\break where $\lambda$ is the penalty term and $n_{i}$ is the number of observations. 
If $n_{i}$ is large, $\lambda$ has almost no impact on $\hat{b}_i(\lambda)$. But if $n_{i}$ is small, the penalty induced by $\lambda$ is large.^[[Introduction to Data Science by Rafael Irizarry]("https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/large-datasets.html#recommendation-systems")]

## Regularization approach

The $\lambda$ can be seen as a typical machine learning tuning parameter.
To select the best tuning parameter only the train_set data should be used. Therefore 5 bootstrap cross validations are used to select the optimal value for $\lambda$.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
lambdas = seq(4, 6, 0.1)

set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

B <- 5 # number of bootstrap iterations

rmse_bootstrapping <- replicate(B, {
  
  #create bootstrap sample without using test_set
  boots_index <- sample(1:nrow(train_set),replace = TRUE, size = 1440018)
  train_set_boots <- train_set[-boots_index,]
  test_sub <- train_set[boots_index,] # 20 % of the test_set as bootstrap validation set
  
  # make sure users and movies of train set are in the test set
  test_set_boots <- test_sub %>% 
    semi_join(train_set_boots, by = "movieId") %>% 
    semi_join(train_set_boots, by = "userId")
  
  lost <- anti_join(test_sub, test_set_boots)
  
  train_set_boots <- rbind(train_set_boots, lost)
  
  
  rmse <- map_df(lambdas, function(x){
    
    mu <- mean(train_set_boots$rating)
    
   # movie effects with regularization 
    movie_effects_reg <- train_set_boots %>% 
      group_by(movieId) %>% 
      summarize(b_i = sum(rating - mu)/(n()+x))
    
   # user effects with regularization  
    user_effects_reg <- train_set_boots %>%  
      left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
      group_by(userId) %>% 
      summarize(b_u = sum(rating - mu - b_i)/(n()+x))
    
   # genres effects with regularization
    genres_effects_reg <- train_set_boots %>% 
      left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
      left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
      group_by(genres) %>% 
      summarize(b_g = sum(rating - mu - b_i - b_u)/(n()+x))
    
   # week effects with regularization
    week_effects_reg <- train_set_boots %>% 
      left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
      left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>%
      left_join(genres_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
      group_by(week) %>%

   # making the prediction on the test set 
    prediction <- test_set_boots %>% 
      left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
      left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>%
      left_join(genres_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
      left_join(week_effects_reg, by = "week") %>%  
      mutate(pred = mu + b_i + b_u + b_g + b_w) %>% 
      pull(pred)
    
    # calculating RMSE
    rmse <- RMSE(prediction[which(!is.na(prediction))], 
                 test_set_boots$rating[which(!is.na(prediction))])
    
    tibble(rmse = rmse, lambda = x)
  })

# tibble with results

# defining colnames of tibble
colnames(rmse_bootstrapping_df) <- sapply(seq_len(B), function(x){
  c(paste("RMSE", x, sep = "_"), paste("lambda", x, sep = "_"))
})

# gather tibble

rmse_bootstrapping_df_long <- rmse_bootstrapping_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to = c(".value", "bootstrap_iteration"), 
               names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)" )

# filtering for best lambdas in all bootstrap iterations

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rmse_bootstrapping_df_long %>% 
  filter(bootstrap_iteration == 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lambda, RMSE))+geom_point()+geom_line()
```


\hfill\break 


# Results

As computed above, the optimal value for $\lambda$ seems to be 5.1. Choosing this value, a model is trained using all the edX data to predict on the validation data.

```{r}
validation <- validation %>% mutate(
  date = lubridate::as_datetime(timestamp)) %>% 
  mutate(week = lubridate::round_date(
    date, unit = "week"))

edx <- edx %>% mutate(
  date = lubridate::as_datetime(timestamp)) %>% 
  mutate(week = lubridate::round_date(
    date, unit = "week"))

# defining train_set and test_set as edx and validation

train_set <- edx
test_set <- validation

lambdas <- 5.1

rmse_lambdas_all <- map_df(lambdas, function(x){
  
  mu <- mean(train_set$rating)

    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    left_join(genre_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
    group_by(week) %>% 
    summarize(b_w = sum(rating - mu - b_i - b_u - b_g)/(n()+x))
  
  prediction <- test_set %>% 
    left_join(movie_effects_reg, by = "movieId") %>% 
    left_join(user_effects_reg, by = "userId") %>% 
    left_join(genre_effects_reg, by = "genres") %>% 
    left_join(week_effects_reg, by = "week") %>% 
    mutate(pred = mu+b_i+b_u+b_g+b_w) %>%

rmse_lambdas_all_view <- rmse_lambdas_all %>% 
  mutate(lambdas) %>% arrange(rmse)
rmse_lambdas_all_view %>%

```



# Conclusion

The model reaching an RMSE of `r rmse_lambdas_all_view %>% pull(rmse)` is still a rather simple model but it fulfills the expectation of the edX capstone.

\hfill\break By taking into account the four effects(user-effects(u), movie-effects(i), genres-effects(g), week-effects(w)) observed in the exploratory data analysis, the prediction can be improved compared to a model, that only takes into account the mean of each movie.
The usage of regularization leads to a further, significant improvement of the prediciton, by penalizing the influence of small number of observations.
\hfill\break
In order to select the tuning parameter $\lambda$ without danger of overfitting, the training dataset edx is again partitioned into a test- and train-set. A five fold bootstrap cross validation is used to select the best lambda.

\hfill\break


\hfill\break A variety  of different approaches, extensions and their combination in machine learning ensembles are possible to further improve the models performance.
For example one could use factor analysis, principal component analysis or singular value decomposition to improve prediction accuracy of the "genres-effects" or the "movie-effects". 
For recommendation challenges  specific packages and algorithms were developed. For example the [recommenderlab package]("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recommenderlab/vignettes/recommenderlab.pdf") on CRAN.
